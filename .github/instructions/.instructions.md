# Project Overview

This project is a command-line tool for cleaning up local Git branches that have already been merged or squashed into a target branch (default: `main`). It helps developers maintain a tidy Git environment by removing unnecessary branches.

## Key Features
- Safely deletes local branches that have been merged or squashed into the target branch
- Checks each branch for a merged pull request using GitHub CLI (`gh pr view`); skips branches with open PRs
- Backs up your repository before deleting any branches
- Dry-run mode: preview branches that would be deleted without making changes
- Force mode: delete branches without confirmation
- Specify any target branch to compare against (default: origin/main)
- Configurable log level (debug, info, warn, error) with emoji and timestamped logs
- Fast: only fetches the target branch from origin
- Supports installation via Homebrew and Go
